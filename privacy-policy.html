  <h1>PianoDrill – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how PianoDrill (“the App”) processes and protects
    your information. The App is operated by
    <strong>Wannemacher Software Service GmbH</strong>, based in Nürnberg, Germany
    (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data controller and contact</h2>
  <p>
    Data controller:<br />
    Wannemacher Software Service GmbH<br />
    Nürnberg, Germany<br />
    Email: <a href="mailto:christian.behnisch@outlook.de">christian.behnisch@outlook.de</a>
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 No account / login</h3>
  <p>
    PianoDrill does not require you to create an account or log in. We do not
    collect names, addresses or other direct personal identifiers inside the App.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Purchase and subscription information</h3>
  <p>
    When you purchase a subscription or a one-time lifetime access, the transaction
    is processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play). We do not receive
    your full payment details (such as credit card numbers).
  </p>
  <p>
    We may receive non-personal purchase information from Apple or Google such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the product identifier (e.g. monthly, yearly, lifetime)</li>
    <li>the date and status of the purchase</li>
    <li>anonymous transaction identifiers required to unlock premium features</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Technical information</h3>
  <p>
    The App itself does not use any third-party analytics SDK. The platforms
    (Apple and Google) may provide us with aggregated, anonymized information
    such as install counts, crash reports or country statistics.
  </p>

  <h3>2.4 Microphone access</h3>
  <p>
    PianoDrill uses the device microphone to listen to the notes you play on your
    piano in order to provide real-time feedback. Audio is processed locally on
    your device and is not stored or transmitted to our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
  <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>unlock and maintain access to premium content after a valid purchase,</li>
    <li>ensure the App functions correctly (for example, note recognition),</li>
    <li>fix bugs and improve stability based on crash reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal bases (EU / GDPR)</h2>
  <p>
    Where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies, we process data
    on the following legal bases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR</strong> – to perform the contract with you,
      for example to provide premium content after a purchase.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR</strong> – our legitimate interest in improving
      the App and ensuring secure, stable operation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data sharing and processors</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited information with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> (for iOS/iPadOS purchases via the App Store)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Google LLC</strong> (for Android purchases via Google Play)
    </li>
    <li>
      Service providers that host our websites or crash reporting tools, if used,
      under appropriate data protection agreements.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Some of the services we use may be operated from countries outside the EU/EEA,
    such as the United States. In such cases, we rely on appropriate safeguards
    such as standard contractual clauses where required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain purchase-related data only for as long as necessary to provide access
    to premium content, comply with legal obligations (for example, tax and accounting),
    and resolve disputes. Technical logs and crash reports are kept only as long as
    needed to debug and improve the App.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your rights (EU / GDPR)</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on applicable law, you may have the following rights regarding your
    personal data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right of access (to know what data we process),</li>
    <li>Right to rectification,</li>
    <li>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”),</li>
    <li>Right to restriction of processing,</li>
    <li>Right to data portability,</li>
    <li>Right to object to certain processing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise these rights, you can contact us at

    PianoDrill is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
    collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided
    us with personal data, please contact us so that we can delete it.
  </p>
