  <h1>PianoDrill – Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the PianoDrill mobile
    application (“the App”), which is operated by
    <strong>Wannemacher Software Service GmbH</strong>, Nürnberg, Germany
    (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By downloading, installing or using the App,
    you agree to be bound by these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope of the App</h2>
  <p>
    PianoDrill is a learning tool designed to help you practice reading and
    recognizing musical notes, especially for piano. The App may offer both
    free features and premium features that require a paid subscription or a
    one-time purchase.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    You may use the App only if you are legally capable of entering into a binding
    contract in your country, or if you have obtained permission from your parent
    or legal guardian.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Purchases, subscriptions and lifetime access</h2>
  <h3>3.1 In-app purchases</h3>
  <p>
    PianoDrill offers in-app purchases, including auto-renewable subscriptions
    (e.g. monthly or yearly) and a one-time lifetime access option. All purchases
    are processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play), and their terms
    and conditions also apply.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Auto-renewable subscriptions</h3>
  <p>
    If you purchase an auto-renewable subscription, your subscription will
    automatically renew at the end of each billing period (for example,
    monthly or yearly) unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the
    current period ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the end
    of the current period, at the price shown in the App at the time of purchase.
    You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your
    <strong>Apple ID / App Store account settings</strong> or
    <strong>Google Play account settings</strong>, depending on your platform.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Lifetime access (non-consumable)</h3>
  <p>
    If you purchase the lifetime access product, you pay a single one-time fee
    to unlock premium features for the lifetime of the App. “Lifetime” refers to
    the active life of the PianoDrill product; we reserve the right to discontinue
    or substantially modify the App in the future.
  </p>

  <h3>3.4 Trial periods and refunds</h3>
  <p>
    If a free trial is offered, it will convert into a paid subscription at the
    end of the trial period unless cancelled at least 24 hours before it ends.
    Refunds are handled exclusively by Apple or Google according to their
    respective refund policies. We cannot grant refunds directly.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>reverse engineer, decompile or attempt to access the source code,</li>
    <li>circumvent or remove technical protection measures,</li>
    <li>use the App in a way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair it,</li>
    <li>use the App to develop a competing product.</li>
  </ul>

    personal, non-commercial use.

  <h2>6. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind,
    either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties
    of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
